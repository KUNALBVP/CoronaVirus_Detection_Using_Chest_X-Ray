# Corona Virus Detection Using Chest X-Ray by applying Convolutional Neural Network
The main concern of this research is to increase the testing efficiency of Covid-19 by predicting the presence of it inside the human body by utlizing the Chest X-Ray images.

In this work, CNN algorithm is applied to classify between the healthy lungs and COVID virus affected lungs by building a deep neural network of 11 convolutional layers. Hence, used to predict and analyze the impact of Covid-19 on the human body.

The result shows that **98% accuracy** is achieved by using the proposed model. Thus, In comparison to the PCR and other testing method, the proposed model is found to be cheaper, more accurate and faster.

## **About The Dataset-**
The dataset can be downloaded from **[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z67ixx_UVTsSVzZBycR9z6SX2mbTQRSK?usp=sharing)**

The dataset contains the Chest X-Ray images (in Posteroanterior (PA) view) of normal as well as Covid affected persons. 80% dataset is used for the training of the proposed model and rest 20% for the validation purpose.
